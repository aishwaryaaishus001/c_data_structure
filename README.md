# Data Structures in C

This repository contains C programs implementing various data structures and algorithms. These were developed as part of academic coursework and lab exercises.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **arrays/** – Searching and sorting algorithms like:
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **graphs/** – Graph traversal algorithms like:
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - Hashing basics
- **linked_lists/** – Implementation and operations of:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Linked List variations
- **queues/** – Linear and Circular Queue implementations and operations.
- **stacks/** – Stack operations and applications like postfix expression evaluation.
- **trees/** – Tree structures including:
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - Basic tree operations
- **others/** – Miscellaneous files including:

## 💻 Language Used

- **C** – All programs are implemented using standard C.

## ⚙️ How to Compile

Use `gcc` to compile any of the `.c` files. Example:

```bash
gcc arrays/binarysearch.c -o binarysearch
./binarysearch
